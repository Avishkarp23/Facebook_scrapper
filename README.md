# Facebook_scrapper
Finding rooms in metropolitian cities in India is really very cumbersome task.There are lot of facebook groups which help us post information about rooms available in particular and according to that there is lot of data which is unstructured which can be structured by data anakytics tools like pandas .In this project I have tried to implement a web scrapper which is able to scrap the description of  post which lists the availability of room using Selenium and BeautifulSoup library of python.
